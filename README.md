# Javascript30
This is my finished code from Wes Bos' Javascript30. 

### Day 1 - Javascript Drumkit
This addressed event listeners and query selectors. I learned the purpose of data attributes. I have used them in the past, but I didn't know why they were being used.

### Day 2 - Javascript and CSS Clock
This looked at transition and transform in CSS. It also used javascript date functions. I learned about the inherit javascript date funtions, where previously I have used the Minute library.
