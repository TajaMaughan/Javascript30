# Javascript30
This is my finished code from Wes Bos' Javascript30. 

## Day 1 - Javascript Drumkit
This addressed event listeners and query selectors. I learned the purpose of data attributes. I have used them in the past, but I didn't know why they were being used.

## Day 2 - Javascript and CSS Clock
This looked at transition and transform in CSS. It also used javascript date functions. I learned about the inherit javascript date funtions, where previously I have used the Minute library.

## Day 3 - CSS Variables
This teaches the use of CSS variable, and how they can by dynamically updated. I had no idea that this was even a thing, and I'm glad I learned it. It's pretty awesome. I also learned more about data attributes.
